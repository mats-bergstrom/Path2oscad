Simple perl script to extract paths from an inkscape SVG and create
an OpenScad file with a polygon points path suited for polygon().
Each path in the SVG results in a separate open scad file with a single
array of points.

It's a Quick and Dirty Hack, works for now.  I'll parse the svg properly
with an xml parser when I have time...

HOWTO:
	Draw a path in inkscape
	Make sure all segments are lines by "Edit Path by Nodes" (F2),
	select all nodes (C-a) and press "Make selected segments lines".
	Label the object (Menu "Object"->Object), edit label from pathNNNN to
	what you find suitable.
	Save.

	path2scad.pl input-file.svg

	The output file will create 4 scalars (X/Y min/max) and an array of
	points with the path.  These are named
	       path_<label>_xmin, path_<label>_xmax,	for x min/max
	       path_<label>_ymin, path_<label>_ymax,	for y min/max
	       path_<label>	  			for the point array.

	In the scad file:
		include <input-file.svg.scad>
		polygon( path<label> );
